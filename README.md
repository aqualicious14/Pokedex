The Pokedex project is a Python script designed to replicate the functionality of a Pokedex from the Pokemon universe. It provides users with a wide range of features to interact with Pokemon data, including displaying Pokemon details, searching by type, filtering by stats, and even catching Pokemon. The script utilizes CSV parsing and menu-driven interaction to offer an immersive experience for Pokemon enthusiasts.
